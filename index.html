  <h1>My Favourite City: London</h1>

<p>
London is one of the most exciting cities in the world. I love its history,
its culture, and the way every street feels different. From the River Thames
to the museums, there is always something new to explore. I enjoy walking
around Greenwich, visiting markets, and discovering new food places. London
is busy, colourful, and full of life.

There are many reasons why London inspires me. The city brings together

and endless opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it’s exploring museums,
trying new foods, or simply walking along the river, London always feels
